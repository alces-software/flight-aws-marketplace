#Flight AWS Marketplace Templates
##8-node cluster

This template creates up to an 8-node HPC environment using the Alces Flight Compute appliance for Linux - together with a private cluster network. The template allows you to start with an optional number of compute nodes, ranging from 1 up to the maximum 8 nodes. Compute nodes have a wide range of popular compute instance types available including; compute optimised, memory optimised and GPU enabled instance types. The compute nodes automatically scale up and down based on the cluster scheduler load - this feature can be disabled if preferred.

The user is also able to choose a login node instance type, defining the number of cores and memory available to the instance.

##16-node cluster

This template creates up to an 16-node HPC environment using the Alces Flight Compute appliance for Linux - together with a private cluster network. The template allows you to start with an optional number of compute nodes, ranging from 1 up to the maximum 16 nodes. Compute nodes have a wide range of popular compute instance types available including; compute optimised, memory optimised and GPU enabled instance types. The compute nodes automatically scale up and down based on the cluster scheduler load - this feature can be disabled if preferred.

The user is also able to choose a login node instance type, defining the number of cores and memory available to the instance.

##32-node cluster

This template creates up to an 32-node HPC environment using the Alces Flight Compute appliance for Linux - together with a private cluster network. The template allows you to start with an optional number of compute nodes, ranging from 1 up to the maximum 22 nodes. Compute nodes have a wide range of popular compute instance types available including; compute optimised, memory optimised and GPU enabled instance types. The compute nodes automatically scale up and down based on the cluster scheduler load - this feature can be disabled if preferred.

The user is also able to choose a login node instance type, defining the number of cores and memory available to the instance.

##X-node cluster

This template creates a HPC environment using the Alces Flight Compute appliance for Linux with an optional number of compute nodes up to the maximum of 32. Compute nodes have a wide range of popular compute instance types available including; compute optimised, memory optimised and GPU enabled instance types. The compute nodes automatically scale up and down based on the cluster scheduler load - this feature can be disabled if preferred.

The user is also able to choose a login node instance type, defining the number of cores and memory available to the instance.
